Cabinet will use MongoDB to store and manage data.
Don't worry, this is easy and free for our purposes.

To create a MongoDB account using the free tier, follow these instructions:

1. Visit the MongoDB website: https://www.mongodb.com/
2. Click on the "Try Free" button.
3. Sign up for a free MongoDB account by providing the required information.
    - If prompted to create a new project, give any name you'd like.
4. Once you have created your account and logged in, create a new cluster.
    - Give the cluster any name you'd like.
5. Create a new database in your cluster with the name of your choice.
    - Name the collection "cabinet".
    - Unless you have a specific reason, don't add "additional preferences".
