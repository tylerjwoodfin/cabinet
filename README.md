# cabinet
A Python library to easily store data across multiple projects in one or more JSON files.

Supports a cli, email, and event logging.

## Features

- Read and write data in the JSON files of your choice
- Log to a file/directory of your choice without having to configure `logger` each time
- Send/receive mail using `cabinet.Cabinet().mail()`

## Structure

- Data is stored in a `settings.json` file in the location of your choice
- Logs are written to `{/path/to/cabinet}/log/LOG_DAILY_YYYY-MM-DD` by default
  - this can be changed on a per-log basis

## Installation and Setup

```bash
  python3 -m pip install cabinet

  cabinet --config
```

  --to TO_ADDR, -t TO_ADDR
```

## Configuration

- Upon first launch, will prompt you to choose a location for `settings.json`. You can change this at any time with `cabinet --config`.

### edit_file() shortcuts
- see example below to enable something like
  - `cabinet -ef shopping` from the terminal
    - rather than `cabinet -ef "/home/{username}/path/to/shopping_list.md"`
  - or `cabinet.Cabinet().edit("shopping")`
    - rather than `cabinet.Cabinet().edit("/home/{username}/path/to/whatever.md")`

file:
```
# example only; these commands will be unique to your setup

{
  "path": {
    "edit": {
      "shopping": {
        "value": "/home/{username}/path/to/whatever.md",
      },
      "todo": {
        "value": "/home/{username}/path/to/whatever.md",
      }
    }
  }
}
```

set from terminal:
```
cabinet -p edit shopping value "/home/{username}/path/to/whatever.md"
cabinet -p edit todo value "/home/{username}/path/to/whatever.md"
```

### mail

- It is NEVER a good idea to store your password in plaintext; for this reason, I strongly recommend a "throwaway" account that is only used for sending emails
- Gmail (as of May 2022) and most other mainstream email providers won't work with this; for support, search for sending mail from your email provider with `smtplib`.
- In `settings.json`, add the `email` object to make your settings file look like this example:

file:
```
{
    "email": {
        "from": "throwaway@example.com",
        "from_pw": "example",
        "from_name": "Raspberry Pi",
        "to": "destination@protonmail.com",
        "smtp_server": "example.com",
        "imap_server": "example.com",
        "port": 123
    }
}
```

set from terminal:
```
cabinet -p email from throwaway@example.com
cabinet -p email from_pw example
...
```

## Examples

### `put`

python:
```
from cabinet import Cabinet

cab = Cabinet()

cab.put("employee", "Tyler", "salary", 7.25)
```

or terminal:
```
# warning - from the terminal, numeric values in cabinet are stored as strings
cabinet -p employer Tyler salary 7.25
```

results in this structure in settings.json:
```
{
    "employee": {
        "Tyler": {
            "salary": 7.25 # or "7.25" if done from terminal
        }
    }
}
```

### `get`

python:
```
from cabinet import Cabinet

cab = Cabinet()

print(cab.get("employee", "Tyler", "salary"))
```

or terminal:
```
cabinet -g employee Tyler salary
```

results in:
```
7.25
```

### `edit_file`

python:
```
from cabinet import Cabinet

cab = Cabinet()

# if put("path", "edit", "shopping", "/path/to/shopping.md") has been called, this will edit the file assigned to that shortcut.

# opens file in Vim, saves upon exit
cab.edit("shopping")

# or you can edit a file directly...
cab.edit("/path/to/shopping.md")
```

terminal:
```
# assumes path -> edit -> shopping -> path/to/shopping.md has been set
cabinet -ef shoppping

or 

cabinet -ef "/path/to/shopping.md"
```

### `mail`

python:
```

from cabinet import Mail

mail = Mail()

mail.send('Test Subject', 'Test Body')

```

terminal:
```
cabinet --mail --subject "Test Subject" --body "Test Body"

# or

cabinet --mail -s "Test Subject" -b "Test Body"
```

### `log`

python:
```
from cabinet import Cabinet

cab = Cabinet()

# writes to a file named LOG_DAILY_YYYY-MM-DD in the default log folder (or cab.get('path', 'log')) inside a YYYY-MM-DD folder

cab.log("Connection timed out") # defaults to 'info' if no level is set
cab.log("This function hit a breakpoint", level="debug")
cab.log("Looks like the server is on fire", level="critical")
cab.log("This is fine", level="info")

# writes to a file named LOG_TEMPERATURE

cab.log("30", logName="LOG_TEMPERATURE")

# writes to a file named LOG_TEMPERATURE in /home/{username}/weather

cab.log("30", logName="LOG_TEMPERATURE", filePath="/home/{username}/weather")

    # format
    # 2021-12-29 19:29:27,896 — INFO — 30

```

terminal:
```
# defaults to 'info' if no level is set
cab -l "Connection timed out" 

# -l and --log are interchangeable
cab --log "Connection timed out"

# change levels with --level
cab --log "Server is on fire" --level "critical"
```
